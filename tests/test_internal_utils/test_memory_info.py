# Intentionally left blank

# The results of the code are so nondeterministic that is would be very hard
# to test it properly.
# The code is so simple, however, that the tests are not necessary.
# Some mock-modules etc. needed for tests would be more likely to contain an
# error than the actual code.

# Of course, should the code change, an edit of this message and maybe an
# addition of the tests is required.
